## Problem Statement

1. Create a Class Animal, should have a name, distance covered by and behavior of that animal:
 Class Animal {name: string; move(distance) {}; makeSound() {} ...}
 
2.Then create 2 more class which will extend Animal class with its property and behaviour
for each show the name, distance and sound.
 For example: Class Tiger extends Animal {...}

## Solution
Created 4 Tyscript files where implementation.ts is the file which demonstrates the use of the classes. The output is captured in the following screenshot file
